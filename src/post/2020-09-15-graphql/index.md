I have been dabbling with GraphQL for some time now but I still don't know much about it.  Now that we, ServiceNow Developers, have to make the definitions for them we need to know a lot more.  I was going to try to write a post about all that but Marcus Reinhardt has an amazing resource.  [https://github.com/noxify/ServiceNow-GraphQL-Example](https://github.com/noxify/ServiceNow-GraphQL-Example)

This is a short post and something so I can find it easily but again thank you Marcus!
