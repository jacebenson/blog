I'd also like to bring up a few possible topics for discussion;

- Hacktoberfest is almost here. Not familiar? https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/
- We are having a local Hackathon for Hacktoberfest.  This is a great opportunity for you to get others to help you work on stuff opened up to the public.  I've got a list of projects I've been saving here: [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OBKZ0Y-E4jBsjCpZcfBKKd0KWc6dyNGiZ_Xhkg4j6mc/edit#gid=1892172882) (if you want to add an idea, [here's the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuETH1NqC2RO3FkD8_OFNvgMHa1-B2R7AnQ4zoeoun1S7Z2g/viewform)).  If you're work would like to host, sponsor, or contribute in any way, please let me know.
- I started a [long thread about 2019: the year of the certified developer](https://twitter.com/jacebenson/status/1166434574852874240).  Chris McQueen is coming up from Iowa and want to talk all things training (and certifications I assume).  So that should be lively.
- New York is GA now.  So that's nice.  Some neat new features.  ([release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-release-notes/page/release-notes/new-features-changes.html))

Hopefully I'll see you Thursday.  There is parking on the street and in the back.
